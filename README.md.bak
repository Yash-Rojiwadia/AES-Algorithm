RSA Implementation in C++ :


(Key Generation, Encryption, Decryption, 2^32 base arithmatic operations)

C++ implementation of RSA algortihm for BigInteger numbers. 

In this project, a C++ implementation has been provided to perform RSA encryption and
decryption for up to 3072 bits of N value. The project also includes random public and private key
generation for RSA algorithm. In order to achieve the desired results, the design includes methods
for basic operations of N bit numbers.


How to run the code :

- The source files are in the /src folder. It contains a script file build.bash. Simply running this file
with ./build.bash command will run the code. It will generate a random set of private public key
and encrypt a random generated message and decrypt it again to show you the original number.
The executable will be generated in the /bin folder. The executable will take an input N where N
represents the number of bits of the Algorithm. i.e. 1920. If no input is given it will assume the
value of N to be 960 bits. The input value can also be changed from the script by changing the last
line of the build.bash file.
./obj <desired value of N>
